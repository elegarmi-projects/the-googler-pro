## Description
Marissa Ann Mayer (born May 30, 1975) is an American businesswoman and investor who graduated from the Stanford University. She is an information technology executive and co-founder of Sunshine Contact. Mayer formerly served as the president and chief executive officer of Yahoo!, a position she held from July 2012 until June 2017, when she left the company's board.

Marissa joined Google in 1999 as the employee number #20. She started writing code and overseeing small teams of engineers, developing and designing Google's search offerings. She is known for her attention to detail, which helped her become the director of consumer web products.

She is building a new team in Google, and you are her right hand. As her first decision to improve processes in her stream, she wants to launch a note-taking app.

Marissa personally asked you to create the app prototype that allows their users to:

- Login and register (no persistence required)
- Take a new note that contains two kinds of text:
    - Title
    - Description
- Visualize the notes in a grid/list view
- Add tags to the notes
- Delete notes
- Edit notes
